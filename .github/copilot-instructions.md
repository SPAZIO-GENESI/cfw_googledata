# Copilot instructions — repository discovery and focused guidance

Purpose: help AI coding agents become productive quickly by describing how to discover this project's architecture, developer workflows, conventions, and integration points.

**Repository state:**
- Note: At the time this was generated there is no top-level `README.md` or obvious source tree. If this is out-of-date, open `README.md`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Dockerfile`, or `docker-compose.yml` and re-run the agent to update these instructions.

**How to discover the big picture**
- `Search:` look for `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `charts/`, `helm/`, `infra/`, `terraform/`, and `.github/workflows/` to identify services and infra.
- `Entry points:` find `main()` or equivalent in `cmd/`, `src/`, `services/`, or top-level language-specific files (`server.js`, `app.py`, `Program.cs`).
- `Service boundaries:` inspect directories named `api`, `worker`, `frontend`, `shared`, or `pkg` and read their package/module imports to map dependencies.

**Build / test / debug workflows (discover-first approach)**
- `Makefile` / `README.md`: prefer exact commands found there if present.
- Common fallbacks if not present (run from repository root in PowerShell `pwsh`):
  - Node: `npm ci` then `npm test` or `npm run build` if `package.json` exists.
  - Python: `python -m venv .venv; .\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1; pip install -r requirements.txt; pytest` if `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` exists.
  - Go: `go test ./...` then `go build ./...` if `go.mod` exists.
  - .NET: `dotnet restore && dotnet build && dotnet test` if `.sln` or `*.csproj` files exist.
  - Containers: `docker build -t repo:local -f Dockerfile .` and `docker-compose up --build` if `docker-compose.yml` exists.

**Project-specific conventions to look for**
- Configuration via env files: check for `.env`, `.env.example`, `config/`, or `appsettings.*` — the project likely uses environment variables for secrets and endpoints.
- API contracts: look for `openapi.yaml`, `swagger.json`, or Protobuf (`*.proto`) to understand cross-service contracts.
- Tests: note test locations (e.g., `tests/`, `__tests__/`, or language-specific test packages) and test runner settings in CI (`.github/workflows/*`).

**Integration points & external dependencies**
- Search for references to cloud providers (Azure/GCP/AWS) in `infra/`, `bicep/`, `terraform/`, CI workflows, or files named `azure-pipelines.yml` or `gcloud*`.
- Look for HTTP clients, SDK initializations, or environment variables like `AZURE_`, `GOOGLE_`, `AWS_` to identify external services.

**How to make safe, useful changes**
- Small, focused edits only: prefer building a small failing test or adding a README fragment rather than large refactors.
- When adding code, follow existing directory and naming patterns; if none exist, place new service code under `services/<name>` and tests under `tests/<name>`.

**Merging with an existing file**
- If a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` already exists, preserve any custom sections titled `Important context`, `Do not change`, or `Ops runbook` when merging. Append new discovery bullet points under `Repository discovery`.

**Examples / placeholders (replace after repo scan)**
- If you find `services/api/main.go` then list its packages and entry flags and prefer `go test ./services/api` for unit tests.
- If you find `frontend/package.json`, prefer `npm ci && npm run build` and note the build output folder (e.g., `dist/` or `build/`).

If anything above is unclear or if you can provide a `README.md` or point me to the primary service directory, I will update this file with exact commands and code examples.
